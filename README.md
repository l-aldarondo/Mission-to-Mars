# Mission-to-Mars
Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

## Background
### Purpose

To use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Resources

Software:
- Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, MongoDB Compass 1.32.6, HTML/CSS, Flask 2.1.2
 
<br/>

## Overview 
This project consists of three technical analyses:

- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.

- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.

- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components.

<br/>

## Summary of Results
